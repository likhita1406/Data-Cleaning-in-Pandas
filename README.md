# Data Cleaning in Pandas

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating **data cleaning techniques using Python and Pandas**.  
It walks through practical steps to prepare raw datasets for analysis, including:

- Handling missing values (imputation, removal, or replacement)  
- Splitting and merging columns for better structure  
- Converting data types to appropriate formats  
- Removing duplicates and inconsistent entries  
- Applying string operations to clean text fields  
- Standardizing and normalizing data for analysis  

The notebook serves as a quick reference for common Pandas operations used in data preprocessing before visualization or modeling.
